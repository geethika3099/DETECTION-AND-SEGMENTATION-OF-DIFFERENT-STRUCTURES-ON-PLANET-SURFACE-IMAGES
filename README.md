# DETECTION-AND-SEGMENTATION-OF-DIFFERENT-STRUCTURES-ON-PLANET-SURFACE-IMAGES
The objective of this project is to detect and segment rock images from different planet surface images
The scientists exploring the solar system planets outside earth need to have good idea of terrain of the planet surface for various predictions of surface formation and other research on planet elements. In this project, we collected the images of Mars from various sources and organized a labeled dataset. The detection of  rocks in the surface images we used CNN model with matplotlib and we achieved 92% accuracy in identifying a rock. The segmentation of rocks in planet terrain images is complex considering the ill-formed figures and blurry images from satellites. We are working on segmenting the images and deploying it into an application for effective usage.
